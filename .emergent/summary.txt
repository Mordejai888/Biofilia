**what currently exists?**
A complete, frontend-only React application for the Biofilia CoCreativa website has been built. All pages and features requested by the user have been implemented visually. The application is fully styled using Tailwind CSS, incorporates all user-provided assets (images, logos, SVGs, custom font), and uses mock data from . The project is ready for deployment as a static site.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: Guiding the user through deploying the website to Hostinger. The agent discovered that the user had downloaded the project's source code from GitHub instead of the necessary compiled production files. The agent was in the process of rectifying this by preparing the correct deployment package.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: Y
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: NA
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Provide Correct Deployment Files to User (P0)**
  - **Description**: The user needs the contents of the  directory to upload to Hostinger, but they mistakenly downloaded the source code. The agent must provide the correct, compiled files.
  - **Attempted fixes**: The agent provided detailed deployment instructions, but this led to the user downloading the wrong package from GitHub.
  - **Next debug checklist**:
    1.  Ensure the production build in  is current by running yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command..
    2.  Create a new ZIP archive (e.g., ) containing *only* the contents of the  directory.
    3.  Explain clearly to the user the difference between source code and the compiled build files.
    4.  Guide the user on how to obtain this new ZIP file.
    5.  Reiterate the step-by-step instructions for uploading and extracting these files in the Hostinger  directory.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is the final step to fulfill the user's primary goal of getting their website live.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?**: N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: NA

**In progress Task List**:
There are no other tasks in progress.
